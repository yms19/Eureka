The rewards are scaled by appropriate factors to adjust their relative importance. The total reward is the sum of these individual rewards.\n\nThe reward components are also returned as a dictionary for monitoring and analysis purposes. The reward components include:\n- `cart_pos`: Penalty for large cart position\n- `cart_vel`: Penalty for large cart velocity\n- `pole_angle`: Penalty for large pole angle\n- `pole_vel`: Penalty for large pole angular velocity\n- `done`: Penalty if the pole falls or the cart moves too far away\n\nFeel free to adjust the reward scales and penalties based on your specific requirements and experimentation."

We can define the reward function as follows:\n\n```python\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(pos_cart: torch.Tensor, vel_cart: torch.Tensor, pos_pole: torch.Tensor, vel_pole: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Define the reward components\n    cart_reward = torch.exp(-0.1 * (pos_cart ** 2 + vel_cart ** 2))  # Encourage the cart to stay in the center and have low velocity\n    pole_reward = torch.exp(-0.1 * (pos_pole ** 2 + vel_pole ** 2))  # Encourage the pole to stay upright and have low velocity\n    \n    # Compute the total reward by summing the reward components\n    total_reward = cart_reward + pole_reward\n    \n    # Return the total reward and reward components as a dictionary\n    reward_components = {\n        'cart_reward': cart_reward,\n        'pole_reward': pole_reward\n    }\n    return total_reward, reward_components\n```\n\nIn this reward function, we define two reward components:\n1. `cart_reward`: This reward component encourages the cart to stay in the center and have a low velocity. We use the exponential function with a temperature of 0.1 to transform the component.\n2. `pole_reward`: This reward component encourages the pole to stay upright and have a low velocity. We also use the exponential function with a temperature of 0.1 to transform the component.\n\nThe total reward is computed by summing the two reward components.\n\nPlease note that I have assumed that the input variables `pos_cart`, `vel_cart`, `pos_pole`, and `vel_pole` represent the position and velocity of the cart and pole, respectively. If the variable names or meanings are different, please adjust them accordingly."

        "content": "To balance a pole on a cart so that the pole stays upright, we can define a reward function based on the angle of the pole. The idea is to provide positive rewards when the pole is upright and penalize when the pole deviates from the vertical position. Here's an example reward function:\n\n```python\nimport torch\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\n@torch.jit.script\ndef compute_reward(pole_angle: torch.Tensor) -> Tuple[torch.Tensor, Dict[str, torch.Tensor]]:\n    # Define reward range and target pole angle\n    reward_range = torch.tensor([-1., 1.], dtype=torch.float32)\n    target_angle = 0.0\n\n    # Compute the absolute difference between the pole angle and the target angle\n    angle_diff = torch.abs(pole_angle - target_angle)\n    \n    # Calculate the reward as an exponential decay of the angle difference\n    reward = torch.exp(-angle_diff)\n\n    # Normalize the reward to the reward range\n    reward = (2.0 * reward - 1.0) * reward_range[1] + reward_range[0]\n\n    # Create reward components dictionary\n    reward_components = {'angle_difference': angle_diff}\n\n    return reward, reward_components\n```\n\nIn this reward function, the `pole_angle` argument represents the current angle of the pole. The function calculates the absolute difference between the pole angle and the target angle (which is 0.0 for an upright pole). Then, it applies an exponential decay to the angle difference to obtain a reward value. The reward is then normalized to the desired reward range, [-1.0, 1.0]. The function also returns a reward components dictionary, which includes the angle difference value for monitoring purposes.\n\nPlease note that you may need to modify the code slightly to ensure compatibility with the provided `Cartpole` class. Specifically, you may need to adapt the input types and ensure the function is torch.jit.script compatible."
